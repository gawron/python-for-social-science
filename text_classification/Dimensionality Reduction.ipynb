    "Instructor's Note:  This notebook tries to give you some of the motivation and some of the background ideas for two of the most popular methods of dimensionality reduction.  In some cases, some mathematical details are described.  Don't worry about the mathematical details. Try to understand the main idea and try to understand some of the basic ideas of what dimensionality reduction does to your data.  Using your reduced dimensionality representation for visualization or for another application is one thing you will benexpected to know about.  The other thing you will be responsible for is the scikit learn interface for dimensionality reduction.  How do you use reduce your data?  What are some of the parameters you need to think about when you reduce?  What will your data look like after reduction?\n",

    "The iris dataset is a 150x4 2D array. Each row  **represents** an iris with 4 numbers. It is a **4-dimensional representation of the data**.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Another less grandiose way of putting this is that an iris is represented by 4 of its numerical **features**.  \n",
    "In the regression and classification notebook,\n",
    "we explored training a classifier on different subsets of those  4 features, and also on\n",
    "all 4 features.  \n",
    "\n",
    "But why limit ourselves to representations constructed out of subsets of the original 4 features?\n",
    "In the assignment, you are asked to test classifiers trained on **different** representations of the data,\n",
    "for example, on a sepal area feature computed by multiplying the sepal length of each iris\n",
    "by its sepal width.  There is also a petal area representation computed by multiplying the petal length of each iris  by its petal width.  And of course, there is a representation consisting of both sepal\n",
    "area and petal area, ostensibly a 2D representation (the classifier is trained a 150x2 array),\n",
    "but really constructed from information extracted from all 4 dimensions of the original data\n",
    "(we have been referring to Questions 4a and 4b of the assignment).  This sort of transformation of the data, using the original 4 dimensions to compute a 2-dimensional alternative representation, is called **dimensionality reduction**.  The exercise in the homework -- computing 2 area features -- is an intuitively appealing way of representing the data.  It makes sense -- and even better -- it works pretty well.  This is dimensionality reduction by clever idea.\n",
    "\n",
    "But there is a whole cottage industry devoted to finding **algorithms** for dimensionality reduction.  A dimensionality reduction algorithm is a program which, given a dataset of $n$ dimensions, and often a target\n",
    "number of dimensions $m$ ($m \\lt n$), finds the **best** $m$-dimensional representation of that\n",
    "data under some very precise mathematical definition of what \"best\" means.  For\n",
    "example, viewing the data as  150 points in 4-dimensional space, consider each of the pairwise distances\n",
    "(that's 11,175 distances). We might define the best 2D representation as the one that minimizes the overall change in distances between the points.  Thus, if we're we're successful, a certain\n",
    "kind of relationship among the data points is preserved as much as possible.\n",
    "Defining Euclidean distance as what's preserved might be a good\n",
    "idea, for example, if we're using our 2D representation for\n",
    "visualization.  Points that are close in the 4D representation remain close in the \n",
    "reduced representation, so  we're getting a relatively undistorted view\n",
    "of the distance relationships between points in the data, relationships\n",
    "that can't be visualized in the original data.  Optimal distance preservation\n",
    "is the objective of a dimensionality reduction algorithm called\n",
    "**Multi-Dimensional Scaling** (MDS).\n",
    "\n",
    "But the uses of dimensionality reduction go far beyond creating\n",
    "informative visualizations. The general problem of data analysis is discovering\n",
    "meaningful relationships in your data.  This is made more difficult when there\n",
    "are many dimensions (many variables).  Thus, automatic ways of discovering redundancies\n",
    "among the variables, allowing for two or more variables to be compressed into\n",
    "one, or five variables to be compressed into three, are useful both\n",
    "cognitively and computationally. Reduction of variables may make generalizations\n",
    "easier to see or it may bring some computational analysis that was unfeasible\n",
    "suddenly within reach (for example K-Nearest Neighbor Regression,\n",
    "which we used as our example of a nonlinear regressor, may\n",
    "become computationally infeasible with high-dimensionality data,\n",
    "so doing KNN on data that has had its dimensionality reduced in some\n",
    "way is common).\n",
    "Generally reducing dimensions will lose information.\n",
    "Thus, the general goal of dimensionality reduction is to reduce as much as possible while \n",
    "achieving the best possible approximation of the original data.  The different way\n",
    "of defining and implementing these goals distinguish various\n",
    "approaches to dimensionality reduction.  We'll go through this\n",
    "more slowly below.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the most famous  dimensionality reductions technique is **Principle Components Analysis** (PCA).\n",
    "This is closely related to Truncated SVD (as it's called in scikit learn), which we'll explain first,\n",
    "because it's simpler. The SVD in Truncated SVD refers to a  key concept in Linear Algebra,\n",
    "the **singular value decomposition (SVD) of a matrix**.  The SVD of a matrix $A$\n",
    "decomposes it into an exact product of three matrices computed by finding the Eigenvectors and Eigenvalues\n",
    "of $A^{T}A$.  The \"truncation\" in Truncated SVD \n",
    "refers to how the dimensionality reduction is achieved: Use only the\n",
    "top $m$ components (corresponding to the top $m$ leading eigenvalues) of the decomposition.\n",
    "So we start with an **exact decomposition** (the SVD) and then make it approximate\n",
    "by leaving out all but the $m$ most important factors (more precisely, zeroing out the others).  Truncated SVD applied to term-document matrices is called Latent Semantic Analysis or Latent Semantic Indexing (LSA or LSI).  PCA does essentially the same thing as truncated SVD but starts with centered data; if $C$ is the centered version of $A$, then  $C^{T}C$ is the covariance matrix of $A$, so the eigenvectors found are the eigenvectors of the covariance matrix; a consequence of this is that the top $m$ leading eigenvectors are the $m$ vectors that do the best job of accounting for the variance in the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's a rather amazing fact about the truncated SVD that it gives the \n",
    "best $m$-dimensional approximation of the original  data, \n",
    "as measured by something called the Frobenius Norm.  The rigorous idea that\n",
    "you would explore in a Linear Algebra course is that truncated SVD gives\n",
    "the best **rank** $m$ approximation.\n",

It's often the case, especially with higher dimensionality data, that there is a useful linear relationship that at least approximates the data.  That's why PCA and other linear models have proved useful.\n",
