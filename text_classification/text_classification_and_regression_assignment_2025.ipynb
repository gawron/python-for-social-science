Think about whether the data types pandas uses for each column are appropriate for the information being represented in that column.  Also note: There are obviously no Boolean data types directly represented in the data, but you can create some Boolean type columns using `.str.get_dummies()`. For example, try executing `df[\"body-style\"].str.get_dummies()`.  This returns a Dataframe with the Boolean columns derived from the categorial `\"body_style\"` column.
