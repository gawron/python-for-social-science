    "##  Missing: A section introducing Wordl and the concept of a WordlBot.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook we move a significant part of the way toward building a Wordl-bot, a program that can play Wordl significantly better than you.  The  first thing we will focus on is a way of scoring candidate guesses.  Some guesses are  much better than others because on average they knock out more contenders than other candidates.  You need a scoring metric that measures this property: `metric(candidate, all_candidates) = score`.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the rest of this note we give a quick sketch of how a scoring metric works. The intuition\n",
    "we'll try to flesh out is that the best scoring metric knocks out more possibilities than others **on average**.\n",
    "But what does that mean?\n",
    "\n",
    "We saw in the last exercise that the guess \"audio\" left us with 85 candidates.  And we knew that because\n",
    "we executed the function `compatible_words`.  But maybe there was a guess that would\n",
    "have left us with only 50 candidates.  That would have been better. \n",
    "That's an insight, but not an immediately helpful one.\n",
    "How did we arrive at the information that one guess left us with 85 candidates?\n",
    "We computed that by knowing the coloring and then finding the\n",
    "words compatible with that coloring, but computing\n",
    "a coloring requires knowing the target.\n",
    "How do we score guesses when we don't know the target?\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's what we do. We hold the guess constant and we compute\n",
    "the coloring that guess would produce if each of the possible candidate words\n",
    "were the target.  That gives a set of colorings, and each coloring is associated with a set\n",
    "of candidate words (possibly a set of size 1).  This set of sets is called a **partition** and\n",
    "the key insight is that it should be partitions we score. Each of the sets in the partition  is\n",
    "one possible outcome for the set of words left after our guess.  So the\n",
    "simplest idea for scoring the guess is just to compute the average size\n",
    "of those partition sets.  The smaller the average size, the more words \n",
    "eliminated on average, and the better the guess.\n",
    "In fact, since the the sizes of the partition sets add up to\n",
    "N, the total number of candidate words, and we divide by the number\n",
    "of partitions to get average size, minimizing average partition set size\n",
    "is the same as maximizing the number of partition sets.\n",
    "That's not bad.  You could build a pretty good WordlBot with that idea.\n",
    "\n",
    "But it turns out there is a better idea.  Our problem can be phrased:\n",
    "How do we measure the amount of information gained in going\n",
    "from the original set of candidates to a smaller set? \n",
    "If we can answer that question, then we just compute the\n",
    "average of the information gain for each set in the partition\n",
    "and we have a useful score for our guess.  We show\n",
    "below that this sometimes gives a different answer \n",
    "to maximizing the number of partition sets.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is exactly the sort of question answered by a branch of computer science called **Information Theory**.\n",
    "The information theoretic approach often settles on the same answer\n",
    "as average partition size, but it's somewhat more principled\n",
    "and a lot more sophisticated because it is grounded in a \n",
    "mathematical theory for measuring the information of an event,\n",
    "which is in turn grounded in a very satisfying way in probability\n",
    "theory.  What follows is a **very brief** sketch of how \n",
    "something called (**information gain** (closely related to entropy)\n",
    "can be used to determine which guess achieves the average gain in\n",
    "information. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### An information-theoretic measure\n",
    "\n",
    "We have a set of candidate words.  Choose one of them as a guess.\n",
    "Consider each candidate word in turn and determine what\n",
    "coloring would result if that word were the target.\n",
    "For example, if the guess is \"mouth\" and the target \n",
    "word is \"snort\", the resulting coloring would be \"kykyk\" because\n",
    "target letters \"o\" and \"t\" are contained in the guess but not in\n",
    "the correct positions. The candidates \"toxic\", \"south\", and \"topic\" would all\n",
    "get the same coloring as the guess \"mouth\".\n",
    "So \"toxic\", \"south\",  and \"topic\" all\n",
    "go in the same coloring set as the guess \"mouth\".\n",
    "The colorings **partition** the set of candidates: every candidate gets a coloring and no candidate\n",
    "gets more than one.  Another way of saying it is that a guess partitions\n",
    "the set of candidates into a set of coloring classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "So how does this help score a guess? Well, it does help.\n",
    "Now consider comparing the partitions that result from different guesses.\n",
    "Better generally means more coloring classes with\n",
    "fewer members.  For example if the current set\n",
    "of candidate has 24 words, the best possible partitioning would be 24 classes with\n",
    "1 member each.  Because then no matter which candidate turns out to be right,\n",
    "we (errorless logical agents that we are)  would take take one look at the resulting\n",
    "coloring and we would be sure to guess the word on the next guess.\n",
    "\n",
    "So how do we quantify this?  Say there are 24 candidates. What's better,\n",
    "guess A which defines a partition with  2 groups of size 3, 4 groups of size 2, and 10 of size 1,\n",
    "or guess B which defines a partition with 1 group of size 3, 8 groups of size 2, and 5 of size 1?\n",

    "When we make a guess, it earns a coloring, and now we have a new (and smaller!) set of candidate words.\n",
    "That's information gained.\n",
    "We score a  guess  by computing the amount of information\n",
    "gained for each of the colorings it might result in\n",
    "and then taking the average of all the possible information gains.\n",
    "\n",

    "And suppose our next guess narrows things down to one of the two groups with 3 members.  Then a random\n",
    "guess has a 1/3 chance of being the target.  Suppose,\n",
    "on the other hand, we land in one of the 10 groups with 1 member.\n",
    "Then a random guess has a 100% chance of being the target.\n",
    "(we say the \"random\" guess has a probability of 1.0 of being right).\n",
    "Clearly we have gained more information by landing in the seond\n",
    "group than in the first.  We'd like to quantify the intuition that smaller\n",
    "candidate sets are better, and and we're to do that by using the fact\n",
    "that in smaller groups the probability of guessing the answer is higher.\n",
