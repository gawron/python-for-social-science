    "What's happened is this.  In line 1, the variable *a_book* is set globally.  In line 2, the value is printed.  In lines 4-7, a function named *a_dog* is defined which resets the variable value (line 5) and then prints the value (line 6).  In line 8, the function *a_dog* is run, and in line 10, the value is printed again. So the value of *a_book* is printed three times, once before running *a_dog*, once inside *a_dog*, and once after running *a_dog*.  We see that, as might be expected, it changes inside *a_dog*.  What might be less expected is that it changes back to the value it had before after *a_dog* is run.  The assignment of the value in line 5 is just temporary (or *local*).  This is a general feature of Python.  As a rule, variables set inside functions don't retain their value after the function is executed.  This is sometimes inconvenient.  For example, you cat pass a variable storing a count in to a function and have the function return an incremented count.  But there are other ways to get this sort of thing accomplished."
