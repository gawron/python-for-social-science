    "1. **Basic concept**.  An interactive notebook is a kind of spreadsheet consisting of a sequence of **cells** of two types, called **Code cells** and **Markdown cells**. These two types of cells let you do two different things, enter text and interact with Python.  The code cells all begin with an interger in square brackets.  Any time you wish, you can double click on a code cell and edit it, adding or deleting material.  In Jupyter Notebook, When you're done editing, position your cursor in the code cell and hit the `[Enter]` key while holding down the shift key, which we will henceforth write as `[Shift]`-`[Enter]`.  This will execute the code in that cell and give you Python's response (**if there is one**). The equivalent action in Google Colab  is to hover yout cursor over the square brackets at the beginning of the cell and click on the forward arrow that appears.  Keep in mind that Python is responding to the **last** line typed in the cell and some Python statements don't all call for a response.  For example, if you type `2+3` in a code cell and hit `[Shift]`-`[Enter]`, Python will respond `5`, But if you type `X=2+3`, Python says nothing.  It merely changes its state so that the variable `X` is now defined and now has the value `5`.\n",
    "2. **Code cell dependencies**.  Is everything defined?   When you load up a Python notebook, Python doesn't automatically execute all the code in code cells. It waits for you to tell it to. Frequently a code cell will have expressions that will depend on other expressions being defined or on some Python module being loaded, and those things will have happened in cells above the one you're editing.  In that case, executing the cell you're editing **before** executing the cells above will cause a Python error, often a `NameError`.  There are two ways to fix this.  One is to execute the cell with the needed definition and then re-execute the cell you were editing.  This is the scalpel solution.  The hammer solution is to pull down the `Cell` menu and select `Run all above`.  As time goes on and our notebooks become more and more complicated, the hammer solution will work less and less often, or you will become impatient with waiting for unnecessary pieces of code to finish executing.  At that point it will be a good idea to understand the dependencies among code cells and just execute the cells you need for your current editing purposes. Often this will be as simple as just executing the cells in the section of the notebook you're working on.\n",
    "3.  **Help**.  Of course the way to get help is to pull down the `Help` menu, but it is worth pointing out that most of the items there are not for beginners.  The two most important items are\n",
    "    1. Notebook Help (Jupyter only).  This takes you to some web pages that are basically a Tutorials. Highly recommended.\n",
    "    2. Keyboard shortcuts (under `Tools` in Google Colab.) This includes all the ways to get things done with keyboard commands, which are often more efficient than menu shuffling.  Most of the commands begin with `Ctrl-m`.  As with `[Shift]`-`[Enter]`, this means holding down the first key while pressing the second.  So `Ctrl-m` means *hold down the `Control` key while pressing the `m` key.*\n",
    "4.  **Creating new cells**.  Eventually you will be doing assignments in which you create new code cells and new markdown cells.  For now cells of both types have been provided below for you to put your answers in.  When you want to start creating cells, in Jupyter notebook you can use keyboard commands shown in the Keyboard shortcut help that will put new cells above and below the cell your cursor is in.  By default a new cell is a code cell.  There is also a keyboard shortcut for turning a code cell into a markdown cell.  In Google Colab, if you hover your cursor over the top center or bittom center of a cell, buttons for adding new code or text cells\n",
