    "1.  The function `make_pascals_triangle` defined above gives you a working Pascal's triangle and the examples show how to use it.  Write a function `fib_n_from_pascal` that takes two arguments, `n` and a Pascal's Triangle of the sort produced by `make_pascals_triangle`; `fib_n_from_pascal` should return the $n$-th Fibonacci number (so `fib_n_from_pascal(n)` should equal `fibonacci_seq_n (n)`) and it should compute it by doing the correct diagonal sum in Pascal's triangle.  Once you have defined `fib_n_from_pascal`, the code snippet in the cell below should work.\n",
    "2.  You know that the numbers in Pascal's Triangle are the coefficients in the Binomial Theorem. Modify  `fib_n_from_pascal` to eliminate its dependence on a precomputed Pascal's triangle table. Call the modified function   `fib_n_from_binomial`.  It should have a single parameter `n`.  Instead of summing entries in Pascal's triangular table it will sum appropriate binomial coefficients.  Note: if you have done part (a) of this problem, this should be a very small modification.  It is particularly small if you import a standard Python module that provides a function that computes binomial coefficients (it is not, however, named `compute_binomial_coeffient` or anything quite so transparent).  If not, refresh your memory of the Binomial theorem (Google it, I mean), which will tell you another way to compute the numbers in Pascal's Triangle.   Test it in an appropriately m,odified version of the code cell below.\n",
    "3.  This is far from the easiest way to compute the $n$-th Fibonacci number. The closed form is, but it does avoid floating point issues and it sums n/2 numbers instead of n. So, probably no Nobel Prize in CS.  But this is fun."
