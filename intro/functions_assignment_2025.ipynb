    "   1. The game consists of one puzzle a day where you have six chances to guess a five-letter word. Let's call that the target. Each of your guesses must be an English word. Sounds pretty hard so far. There are lots of 5-letter words!\n",
    "\n",
    "   2. But here's the thing.  After you type in your guess, correct letters are highlighted: \n",

    "      \n",
    "      c.  black means the letter does not occur in the target.\n",

    ">kgkky (**s** is  colored black, **k** is green, **i** and **e** are black, **r** is yellow_\n",
    "\n",
    "Each color tells you something about the correponding letter in your guess.\n",
    "That green *g* in the second \n",
    "position means the target has an *k* in the second position (so, based on what we know about English spelling, it likely has a vowel or an *s* in the first position).  That  yellow *r* in the fifth position means there's an *r* somewhere in the word, but not in fifth position, and not in first position, because English words can't start with *rk*, and not in second position, because that's filled with a *k*.  So in fact you know the *r* is in third or fourth position.  And since the other three letters in your guess turned black you know that the target\n",
    "word does not contain an *s*, an *i* or an *e*. And so on, combining simple logic with knowledge of facts \n",

    "Here's what we do. We hold the guess constant and we compute\n",
    "the coloring that guess would produce if each of the possible candidate words\n",
    "were the target.  That gives a set of colorings, and each coloring is associated with a set\n",
    "of candidate words (possibly a set of size 1).  This set of sets is called a **partition** and\n",
    "the key insight is that it should be partitions we score. Each of the sets in the partition  is\n",
    "one possible outcome for the set of words left after our guess.  So the\n",
    "simplest idea for scoring the guess is just to compute the average size\n",
    "of those partition sets.  The smaller the average size, the more words \n",
