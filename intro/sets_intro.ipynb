    "We've seen a number of data structures in the lecture so far, for example:\n",
    "\n",
    "* string: an ordered collection of characters (eg. `'hello'`), so there is a character at index 0 (`'h'`), a character at index 1 (`'e'`), and so on.\n",
    "* list: an ordered collection of anything (eg. `[1, 2, 3, 'a', 1]`), so there is a thing at index 0 (the number `1`), a thing at index 1 (the number `2`), and so on.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sets are collections as well, but unlike strings and lists, they are _unordered_.  You can think of them as a \"bag\" or mathematical set of objects, and so it doesn't make sense to talk about which item in the set is \"first\".\n",
    "\n",
    "If we were to create a set out of our example list `[1, 2, 3, 'a', 1]`, then we would get `1`, `2`, `3`, and `'a'`, but when we came to the second `1` we already have a `1` in the set and so we can't add it again.  So an additional distinction between sets and ordered collections like strings and lists is that you can't have duplicates in a set.\n",
    "\n",
    "There's one other critical distinction between sets and lists: things stored in sets must be immutable (or technically, hashable).  So you can put strings, numbers and tuples into sets, but not dictionaries or lists (since they are mutable).\n",
    "\n",
