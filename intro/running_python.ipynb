Then complete the assignment below in the **Student Confirmation** section of this notebook, answering any questions you are asked by writing Python expressions in the code cells provided.  (In this assignment the questions are all near that one section). In all cases, check your answers by executing the code cell to verify that the output is appropriate.  In some cases you may have to create code or text (**markup**) cells of your own to provide an answer.  Please be sure you've successfully completed all these basics (read the [Jupyter Notebook](https://www.dataquest.io/blog/jupyter-notebook-tutorial/) or [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/basic_features_overview.ipynb) docs if you need more help) as it will be a regular part of assignments and exams.\n",

The Python file is what you will submit on Canvas to receive credit for this assignment. The notebook file is mostly for your own use for review and revision.  In some cases I will ask you to email it to me, for example, when diagnosing a problem you're having running some code, or when there is a plagiarism issue.  You should keep copies of both the .py and the .ipynb files  and update both if needed.  Despite the weird extension, the Python (.py) file is just a text file and you can look at it using any text editor or viewer and you should do that to verify it contains all your work. Do not edit the file using a text editor (especially Word).  If you find a problem and you want to change something, restart your notebook and  edit that and re-execute any relevant code cells and re-save both the notebook and Python versions.  Submit **only** the Python (.py) file on Canvas unless specifically requested otherwise.  Unrequested notebook (.ipynb) files will not be opened.  \n",

    "1. **Basic concept**.  As we saw above, an interactive notebook is a kind of spreadsheet consisting of a sequence of **cells** of two types, code cells and Markdown cells. These two types of cells let you evaluate expressions of Python or enter text.  Any time you wish, you can double click on a code cell and edit it, adding or deleting material.  Evaluate the cell when you're done editing, as shown earlier in this notebook.  Keep in mind that Python will evaluate every line in the cell in a code cell, but it will display output only for the **last** line. Also bear in mind that some lines of Python don't have outputs because they don't return values.  For example, if you type `2+3` in a code cell and hit `[Shift]`-`[Enter]`, Python will respond `5`, But if you type `X=2+3`, Python says nothing.  It merely changes its state so that the variable `X` is now defined and now has the value `5`.\n",
    "2. **Code cell dependencies**.  Is everything defined?   When you load up a Python notebook, Python doesn't automatically execute all the code in code cells. It waits for you to tell it to. Frequently a code cell will have expressions that will depend on other expressions being defined or on some Python module being loaded, and those things will have happened in cells above the one you're editing.  In that case, executing the cell you're editing **before** executing the cells above will cause a Python error, often a `NameError`.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Remember that type of error: `Name Error`.  As a beginner, it is probably going to be the most common type of error you have.  As an experienced old hand, it will probably still rank way up there.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two ways to fix a Name Error.  One is to execute the cell with the needed definition and then re-execute the cell you were editing.  This is the scalpel solution.  The hammer solution is to pull down the `Cell` menu and select `Run all above`.  As time goes on and our notebooks become more and more complicated, the hammer solution will work less and less often, or you will become impatient with waiting for unnecessary pieces of code to finish executing.  At that point it will be a good idea to understand the dependencies among code cells and just execute the cells you need for your current editing purposes. Often this will be as simple as just executing the cells in the section of the notebook you're working on.\n",
    "3.  **Help**.  Of course the way to get help is to pull down the `Help` menu, but it is worth pointing out that most of the items there are not for beginners.  The two most important items are\n",
    "    1. Notebook Help (Jupyter only).  This takes you to some web pages that are basically a Tutorials. Highly recommended.\n",
    "    2. Keyboard shortcuts (under `Tools` in Google Colab.) This includes all the ways to get things done with keyboard commands, which are often more efficient than menu shuffling.  Most of the commands begin with `Ctrl-m`.  As with `[Shift]`-`[Enter]`, this means holding down the first key while pressing the second.  So `Ctrl-m` means *hold down the `Control` key while pressing the `m` key.*  If there is a third key, release the first two before hitting the third.  So `Ctrl-m-H` (show keyboard shortcuts) means *hold down the `Control` key while pressing the `m` key. then press H.*\n",
    "4.  **Creating new cells**.  Eventually you will be doing assignments in which you create new code cells and new markdown cells.  For now cells of both types have been provided below for you to put your answers in.  When you want to start creating cells, in Jupyter notebook you can use keyboard commands shown in the Keyboard shortcut help that will put new cells above and below the cell your cursor is in.  By default a new cell is a code cell.  There is also a keyboard shortcut for turning a code cell into a markdown cell.  In Google Colab, if you hover your cursor over the top or bottom center of a cell, buttons for adding new code or text cells will appear."

    "\n",
    "1. Method  One will work in any notebook.  It uses the `Ipython.display.Image` function to load a URL known to contain an image file.  The `Ipython.display.Image` function can be used to download any image from the web.  More generally, there are various Python resource-loading functions in various Python toolkits that have the capacity to load resources that are either on your local machine.\n",
    "2. Method Two will only work when you are working in the Google tool suite.  You need to be using the notebook as a Google Colab notebook, and you need to be logged in to your Google account.  Finally the file referenced after `'/content/drive'`  needs to have been uploaded to your Google Drive.  I previously saved a copy of the Python Logo in the top level folder of my personal Google Drive as \"python-logo.png\", so when I tried method 2, it worked for me.  \n",
    "\n",
    "   To try out Method Two, first upload the image at the following URL onto your Google Drive:\n",
    "   \n",
    "         https://gawron.sdsu.edu/python_for_ss/course_core/book_draft/_static/python-logo.png    \n",
    "         \n",
    "    Then execute the code in the Method Two cell below. In line 1 the Google Drive module is imported (this will probably only work if you are using the notebook as a Google Colab notebook; most python distributions will not have this module). In line 3 we \"mount\" Google Drive (make it behave as if it is just another folder/directory on your local machine).  In line 4 we load the image into this notebook.  Since it was saved in the toplevel folder of my Google Drive, the folder is `/content/gdrive/My Drive`.\n"
