    "\n",
    "Spelling this out: everything we did in\n",

    "\n",
    "  1.  Compute the basic layout.  This creates a layout object we'll call `pos`,  used in the next steps\n",
    "  2.  Draw the node labels  for `pos`(optional)\n",
    "  3.  Draw the nodes for `pos`, possibly with coloring, and possibly with special outlining\n",
    "  4.  Draw the edges for `pos`, connecting the nodes.\n",
    "  \n",
    "These correspond to the following functions:\n",

    "\n",
    "Almost all complex graphs will benefit from some kind of customization when drawing them.  For example, the layout algorithm does not take labeling into account, so that adding labels to a graph may result in a cluttered, even unreadable, graph.  You can deal with this by leaving some nodes out, or by leaving some edges out, adjusting label size and position, or by factoring some of the information into coloring.  In all cases you need to break the drawing process up into component steps, which allows you to customize some or all of them. \n",
