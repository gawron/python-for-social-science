    "One way of measuring the similarity between two arrays `x` and `y`. is to take their cosine.  The name for this similarity measure is quite appropriate.  The cosine of `x` and `y` is a measure of the geometric cosine of the angle between them.  It is 1 when that angle is 0 (i.e., `x` and `y` are identical in direction), and -1 when the vectors point in opposite directions, and 0 when the vectors are orthogonal (the do not share a component in any direction).  It is computed by taking the dot product of the unit vectors pointing in the same direction as `x` and `y`.  To do this we divide `x` and `y` by their Euclidean length (`LA.norm` in the code below) and take the dot product of the results."
